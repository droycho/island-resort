          <p>Kayaking is a popular pasttime for many locals and tourists alike. There are
          numerous rental sites along the beach with two located in the main lobby of the
          resort.</p>
        <li>Surf</li>
          <img src="images/surfing.jpeg" alt="surfing">
          <p>Like kayaking, surfing is a very popular sport for everyone on the island. Our
          resort proudly hosts an annual surfing competition in the Winter season. Bookings
          go fast during this time, so plan accordingly!</p>
        <li>Camping</li>
          <img src="images/camping.jpeg" alt="camping">
          <p>We don't recommend camping. 500 people were mauled by bears last year alone.
          Only 600 visited the island that year. Don't camp.</p>
        <li>Build a sand castle</li>
          <img src="images/sand_palace.jpeg" alt="Better than just a castle">
          <p>Building sandcastles is for cumps. We build sand-palaces because we're better
          than you and your whole family.</p>
